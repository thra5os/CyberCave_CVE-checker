# Sprint 1: Project Setup and Data Retrieval
## Epoch 1: Project Initialization

* User Story 1: As a developer, I want to set up the project environment with the necessary tools and libraries.*
- Task 1: Set up version control (e.g., Git).
- Task 2: Create project structure.
- Task 3: Set up development environment (e.g., IDE, Python environment)

## Epoch 2: Data Retrieval *

* User Story 2: As a user, I want the application to retrieve a list of installed applications and their versions from my computer. *
- Task 1: Research and identify the appropriate method to retrieve installed applications and their versions (e.g., Windows Registry, command-line tools).
- Task 2: Implement code to extract installed applications and their versions.
- Task 3: Test data retrieval functionality.


# Sprint 2: CVE Database Integration
## Epoch 3: CVE Database Integration

* User Story 3: As a user, I want the application to fetch CVE information based on the versions of installed applications. *
- Task 1: Research and select a CVE database or API to integrate with.
- Task 2: Implement code to query the CVE database/API based on application versions.
- Task 3: Test CVE database integration.

# Sprint 3: Automated CVE Lookup
## Epoch 4: Automated CVE Lookup

* User Story 4: As a user, I want the application to automatically check for CVEs associated with installed application versions and display the results.*
- Task 1: Develop logic to match installed application versions with CVE entries.
- Task 2: Implement code to display CVE information for matched entries.
- Task 3: Test automated CVE lookup functionality.

# Sprint 4: User Interface and Testing
## Epoch 5: User Interface Development

* User Story 5: As a user, I want a user-friendly interface to view CVE information for installed applications.*
- Task 1: Design user interface mockups.
- Task 2: Implement user interface components (e.g., list of installed applications, CVE details).
- Task 3: Test user interface functionality.

## Epoch 6: Testing and Refinement

* User Story 6: As a developer, I want to thoroughly test the application and fix any bugs or issues. *
- Task 1: Conduct unit tests for each module/function.
- Task 2: Perform integration testing to ensure components work together correctly.
- Task 3: Solicit feedback from users and make necessary refinements.

# Sprint 5: Documentation and Deployment
## Epoch 7: Documentation and Deployment

* User Story 7: As a developer, I want to document the application's functionality and deploy it for users to access. *
- Task 1: Write user documentation, including installation instructions and usage guidelines.
- Task 2: Prepare deployment package.
- Task 3: Deploy the application to a suitable platform (e.g., local installation, cloud hosting).rity and Privacy: Ensure that the application handles user data securely and respects user privacy.
